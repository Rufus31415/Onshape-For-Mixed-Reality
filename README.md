# Onshape Unity app for Hololens

This is a short video to present what we developped during a hackathon (24 hours of hack). It is an OnShape app for the Microsoft Hololens.

For those who don't know about OnShape, it is a cloud based CAD solution. 

This is a UWP application that allows you to connect to OnShape and view your 3D models there.

This app uses OnShape's REST API to obtain information about documents, as well as the list of vertices/triangles/normals for display.
